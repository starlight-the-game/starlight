            # Special delivery here!
            
            Before you are fooled by "xx days ago" text in the sidebar, I just want to tell you that, that is not how git `reftag`s works - **the said date is their first creation date!**
            
            The commit hash is what matter. I repeat, please **LOOK AT THE COMMIT HASH** before filling a ticket saying "Your delivery files are outdated!" and ruin my day!
            
            ## What does the files mean?
            - `linux-x64`: intended for most Linux servers.
            - `linux-arm64`: intended for Termux users, including me.
            - `win-x64`: intended for Windows, including but not limited to: Windows, Windows Server, IIS.
            
            ## Make sure port `5000` in your deployment machine is available, and your "middleman" Nginx/Apache is properly configured!
